# Enhanced Workspace Features

## Overview

The workspace has been enhanced to focus on **AI Agents** and **Data Sources** instead of traditional projects. This creates a more intelligent and data-driven workspace experience.

## Key Features

### 1. **Ownership Model**

- **Organization Owners**: Can create workspaces and manage organization settings
- **Workspace Owners**: Can add data sources (files/databases) and manage agents
- **Members/Viewers**: Can view workspaces and interact with agents but cannot modify data sources

### 2. **Data Sources Management**

- **File Uploads**: Secure S3 storage with automatic LLM processing (workspace owners only)
- **Database Connections**: Connect external databases for data analysis (workspace owners only)
- **AI-Powered Summaries**: Automatic file analysis and summary generation

### 3. **AI Agents System**

- **Conditional Availability**: Agents only become available when data sources are connected
- **Intelligent Processing**: LLM-powered analysis of uploaded files
- **Context-Aware**: Agents understand your data and provide relevant insights
- **Owner Management**: Only workspace owners can edit/delete agents

### 4. **Enhanced File Management**

- **Secure Storage**: Files stored in AWS S3 with proper access controls
- **Automatic Processing**: Background LLM analysis of uploaded files
- **Rich Metadata**: File summaries, key points, tags, and reading time
- **Dedicated Pages**: Individual file detail pages with full functionality

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

- Enhanced `file_uploads` table with S3 integration
- New `file_summaries` table for LLM-generated content
- `ai_agents` table for agent management
- `workspace_data_sources` for tracking connected data
- `file_processing_queue` for background job management

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/workspaces/[id]/files` - Upload files with S3 storage
- `GET /api/workspaces/[id]/files` - List workspace files
- `GET /api/workspaces/[id]/files/[fileId]` - Get file details
- `PUT /api/workspaces/[id]/files/[fileId]` - Update file metadata
- `DELETE /api/workspaces/[id]/files/[fileId]` - Delete files

### Security Features

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Secure S3 access with signed URLs

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=insighter-files

# LLM Configuration (for file processing)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
# or
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
```

### Database Setup

Run the enhanced schema to add new tables:

```sql
-- Execute the enhanced-schema.sql file
\i scripts/enhanced-schema.sql
```

## User Experience

### Workspace Dashboard

- **Data Sources Section**: Shows connected files and databases
- **AI Agents Section**: Displays available agents (only when data is connected)
- **Quick Actions**: Upload files, connect databases, create agents
- **Data Overview**: Statistics about connected data sources

### File Management

- **Upload Interface**: Drag-and-drop file upload with progress
- **Processing Status**: Real-time updates on file processing
- **AI Summaries**: Automatic generation of file summaries and key points
- **File Details**: Dedicated pages for each file with full metadata

### Agent System

- **Conditional Access**: Agents only appear when data sources are available
- **Intelligent Analysis**: LLM-powered insights from your data
- **Context Awareness**: Agents understand your specific data and use cases

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Advanced Agent Types**: Specialized agents for different data types
2. **Real-time Processing**: Live file analysis and updates
3. **Collaborative Features**: Share files and agents with team members
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Deeper insights and data visualization
5. **Integration Hub**: Connect with more external data sources

### Technical Roadmap

1. **Background Job Processing**: Implement proper queue system for file processing
2. **LLM Integration**: Connect with multiple LLM providers
3. **Performance Optimization**: Caching and optimization for large files
4. **Monitoring**: Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all new features

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- All files encrypted in S3
- Secure access tokens with expiration
- Proper user authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Privacy

- User data isolation
- Secure file processing
- No data sharing between workspaces
- GDPR compliance considerations

## Performance

### Optimization Features

- Lazy loading of file content
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- S3 signed URLs for secure file access
- Background processing to avoid blocking UI

### Scalability

- Horizontal scaling with S3
- Database optimization with proper indexes
- Rate limiting to manage resource usage
- Efficient file processing queue

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Metrics Tracked

- File upload success rates
- Processing times and errors
- User engagement with agents
- Data source utilization

### Logging

- Comprehensive API logging
- Error tracking and reporting
- Performance monitoring
- Security event logging

This enhanced workspace system provides a solid foundation for building intelligent, data-driven applications with AI agents that can understand and work with your specific data.
