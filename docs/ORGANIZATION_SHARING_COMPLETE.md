## 🎯 **Permission Hierarchy**

```
Organization (Top Level)
├── Owner: Full control over organization and all resources
├── Admin: Manage members, workspaces, and content
├── Member: Create and manage content within workspaces
└── Viewer: Read-only access to organization resources

Workspace (Inherits from Organization)
├── Admin: Full workspace control (inherited from org admin/owner)
├── Member: Create and manage agents/canvases (inherited from org member)
└── Viewer: Read-only access (inherited from org viewer)

Agent & Canvas (Inherits from Workspace)
├── Full Access: Based on workspace membership
└── Read-only: Based on workspace viewer role
```

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **1. Create Organization**

- Users automatically become **owners** when creating organizations
- Full control over organization and all resources

### **2. Invite Users**

- Click the **share button** on organization cards
- Enter **email address** and select **role**
- Invitation sent with secure token (7-day expiration)

### **3. Manage Members**

- View all organization members and their roles
- Update member roles (Owner/Admin only)
- Remove members with automatic cleanup

### **4. Workspace Access**

- Users automatically get workspace access based on organization role
- Workspace permissions inherited from organization membership
- Direct workspace invitations also supported

### **5. Role-Based UI**

- Interface adapts based on user permissions
- Share buttons only visible to authorized users
- Role indicators and management controls

## 📊 **API Usage Examples**

### **Invite User to Organization**

```typescript
const response = await fetch(`/api/organizations/${orgId}/invite`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: "user@example.com",
    role: "member",
  }),
});
```

### **Check User Permissions**

```typescript
import { checkOrganizationPermission } from "@/lib/permissions";

const canInvite = checkOrganizationPermission(userRole, "INVITE_MEMBERS");
if (canInvite.hasPermission) {
  // Show invite button
}
```

### **Get Organization Members**

```typescript
const response = await fetch(`/api/organizations/${orgId}/members`, {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
});
const members = await response.json();
```

## 🔒 **Security Features**

- **Authentication**: JWT token required for all operations
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Input Validation**: Email format, role validation
